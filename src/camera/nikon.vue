        <h3 class="bold">Advantages</h3>
          1. Nikon has a good reputation for image quality, with good performance in both sharpness and latitude. Suitable for landscape photography.<br>

          2. Nikon uses better materials than Canon, has slightly better focusing technology, and is more durable.<br>

          3. The price/performance ratio is high, and the cameraâ€™s sensitivity is also the highest.
        <br><br>
         <h3 class="bold">Disadvantages</h3>
          1. The color tone is cooler and the film is greener. <br>

          2. Some mid- to low-end Nikon models may not be as good as professional-level cameras in terms of dustproof and waterproof performance. <br>

          3. Nikon is relatively conservative in releasing new models, and the speed of updating may not be as fast as that of some competitors.
