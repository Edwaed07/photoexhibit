        <h3 class="bold">Advantages</h3>
        1. The cheapest full frame. Sony's biggest advantage is that full frame is cheap.<br>

        2. Sony is very portable and easy to take out. <br>

        3. Sonyâ€™s 4K video recording allows you to experience the perfect experience of recording 4K high-definition videos yourself. <br>

        4. Five-axis anti-shake. Cameras after the Sony mirrorless A7 series have 5-axis anti-shake function. 
        This is a very powerful feature, so that most of the time you can discard the bulky tripod.
        <br><br>
         <h3 class="bold">Disadvantages</h3>
          1. Expensive. Sony's body is relatively cheap, but the lens is more expensive than other lenses of the same specification. <br>

          2. The picture quality is worse, and the video performance is better. <br>

          3. Compared with some old camera brands, Sony's lenses may be slightly lacking in the selection of specific lens types.
