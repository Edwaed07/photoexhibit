        <br><br>
         <h3 class="bold">Disadvantages</h3>
        1. Poor flash technology. The color and white balance are reduced when the flash is turned on, and the external flash is more expensive.<br>
        2. There is no focus assist light. Low-end cameras often tend to lose focus when turning on the flash.<br>
        3. High-end cameras are of better quality, while mid- to low-end cameras are average.<br>
        3. The battery life may be relatively short, requiring more frequent battery replacement.
